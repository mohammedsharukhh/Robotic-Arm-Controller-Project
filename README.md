# Robotic-Arm-Controller-Project
---------------------------------
Android based robotic arm is designed to provide access to places where human presence must be avoided.

Such as places with very low or very high atmospheric pressure, war zones and even biohazardous places.

It can also be used for repetitive and cumbersome works like automobile painting, assembly work in manufacturing processes.

The system uses an Arduino UNO board that controls the movement robotic arm through Servo motors. The Arduino uno board is connected with a Bluetooth module for wireless connection of android device. An android app is used to provide commands to the robotic arm. This gives the user to work on particular task from a safe distance.
